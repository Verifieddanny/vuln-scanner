# 🛡️ Web Vulnerability Scanner: Protect Your Website from Threats! 🛡️

This project provides a robust and easy-to-use web vulnerability scanner to help you identify security weaknesses in your websites. 🕵️‍♂️ It's like having a security expert on demand! 🚀

## 💡 What it Does

This scanner automatically probes your website for common vulnerabilities, providing detailed reports to help you strengthen your security posture. Think of it as a health check for your website's security. 🩺

Here's a breakdown of the key features:

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Scanning:** Detects vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into your website, potentially stealing user data or hijacking sessions. 😈
*   **SQL Injection Scanning:** Tests for weaknesses that could enable attackers to manipulate your database, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. 🗄️
*   **Security Header Scanning:** Verifies the presence and correct configuration of essential security HTTP headers, such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, and HSTS, which protect against various attacks. 🛡️
*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Scanning:** Identifies vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to trick your server into making unauthorized requests to internal or external resources. 🌐
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Scanning:** Checks for weaknesses that could allow attackers to trick users into performing unwanted actions on your website without their knowledge. 🎭
*   **RCE (Remote Code Execution) Scanning:** Tests for critical vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on your server. 💥
*   **LFI (Local File Inclusion) Scanning:** Identifies vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to access sensitive files on your server. 📁
*   **NoSQL Injection Scanning:** Checks for vulnerabilities in NoSQL databases that could allow attackers to manipulate queries and access unauthorized data. 🗄️
*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Misconfiguration Scanning:** Detects misconfigured CORS policies that could allow unauthorized access to your website's resources from other domains. 🌐
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure Scanning:** Looks for exposed sensitive data like API keys, AWS keys, email addresses, private keys, social security numbers, and credit card numbers in your website's responses. 🕵️‍♀️
*   **Sensitive File Exposure Scanning:** Checks for publicly accessible sensitive files such as `.git/config`, `.env`, and `phpinfo.php`. 📁

## 🛠️ How to Use It

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone [https://github.com/Verifieddanny/vuln-scanner.git]` ⬇️
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install` or `yarn install` 📦
3.  **Run the project:** `npm run dev` or `bun run dev` or `yarn run dev` ▶️
4.  **Access the web interface:** Open your browser and navigate to the appropriate URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`). 🌐
5.  **Enter the target URL:** Provide the URL of the website you want to scan. 🎯
6.  **Select scan options:** Choose the specific vulnerability types you want to check for. ✅
7.  **Start the scan:** Click the "Start Scan" button. 🚀
8.  **Review the results:** The scanner will generate a detailed report with any vulnerabilities found. 📝

## ⚙️ How it Works

This project uses a combination of techniques to detect vulnerabilities, including:

*   **Payload Injection:** Injecting specially crafted inputs to test how the website handles them.
*   **Response Analysis:** Analyzing the server's responses for error messages, indicators of successful attacks, and missing security headers.
*   **Regular Expressions:** Using regular expressions to identify patterns of sensitive data.

The backend is built with Node.js and uses `axios` for making HTTP requests. The frontend is built with React and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the scanner.
